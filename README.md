# julia-JetSubstructure

A repository to try out existing Jet Reconstruction techniques in Julia and develop new modules for analysing the underlying jet substructure. This is a naive implementation of the substructure modules of the Fastjet package.

A benchmark comparison of the Julia implementation of jet reconstruction with that of the Python representation has also been provided.
